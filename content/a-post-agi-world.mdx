# Creativity as Currency - A Post-AGI World

Recently I read a uniquely thought provoking article called [*Capital, AGI, and human ambition*](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KFFaKu27FNugCHFmh/by-default-capital-will-matter-more-than-ever-after-agi). The author, [*L Rudolf L*](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/l-rudolf-l), explores and reflects on a post-AGI<Sidenote>Artificial General Intelligence (ASI) can be simply defined as an antificial intelligence which is directly comporable to human intelligence. Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) is an intelligence which *surpasses* human intelligence. Sometimes these terms are used interchangably.</Sidenote> future that would <Highlight>"shift the relative importance of human v non-human factors of production.</Highlight> I found this to be a very interesting read, and I want to zoom in on one of the author's perceptions, and expand on it.

## What happens to the value of  labor with AGI?

<Callout>
Labor = human mental and physical effort that produces something of value<br/>
Capital = things humans have build that are used in the produciton of goods and services
</Callout>

The author states, "The key economic effect of AI is that it makes capital a more and more general substitute for labour. There's less need to pay humans for their time to perform work, because you can replace that with capital."

<EconomicValueChart />

$$\text{Value} = \text{Capital} \cdot \text{Labor}$$


So, humans (as a function of their labor) are now less valuable in comparison to technology (as a function of capital). Why should I hire an analyist when I can use an agent<Sidenote>agent descrtiotion here</Sidenote>? The anlayst will complain if I give them menial tasks. The agent will say "Absolutely! Here's is the code to do it."<Sidenote>syncophacy</Sidenote>. The anlayist will cost \$100,000 a year. The agent will cost \$100 a month (in our AGI world). The anlysis will want to go home at 5, the agent will work 24/7.

The author states, "Sufficiently strong AI will by default obsolete human entrepreneurship. For example, VC funds might be able to directly convert money into hundreds of startup attempts all run by AIs, without having to go through the intermediate route of finding a human entrepreneurs to manage the AIs for them."
