# Advanced animation patterns with Framer Motion

A deep dive into Framer Motion's propagation, exit transitions and layout animation patterns through curated examples and interactive playgrounds.

## Introduction

Framer Motion is a production-ready animation library for React. It's a great tool for creating complex animations and interactions with a simple and intuitive API. In this article, we'll explore some advanced animation patterns that Framer Motion enables, such as propagation, exit transitions, and layout animations.

## Propagation

Propagation is the ability to animate a component and its children at the same time. This is useful when you want to create a staggered effect, where each child animates with a delay relative to its parent. Framer Motion makes this easy with the `staggerChildren` and `staggerDirection` props.

- `staggerChildren` defines the delay between each child animation.
- `staggerDirection` defines the direction in which the stagger should occur.
- `staggerDelay` defines the delay before the stagger starts.

**Stagger children**

## hello

```jsx

import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

const containerVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: { opacity: 1, transition: { staggerChildren: 0.1 } },
};

```
