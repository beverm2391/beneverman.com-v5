# Advanced animation patterns with Framer Motion

A deep dive into Framer Motion's propagation, exit transitions and layout animation patterns through curated examples and interactive playgrounds.

## Introduction

Framer Motion is a production-ready animation library for React. It's a great tool for creating complex animations and interactions with a simple and intuitive API. In this article, we'll explore some advanced animation patterns that Framer Motion enables, such as propagation, exit transitions, and layout animations.

## Propagation

Propagation is the ability to animate a component and its children at the same time. This is useful when you want to create a staggered effect, where each child animates with a delay relative to its parent. Framer Motion makes this easy with the `staggerChildren` and `staggerDirection` props.

- `staggerChildren` defines the delay between each child animation.
- `staggerDirection` defines the direction in which the stagger should occur.
- `staggerDelay` defines the delay before the stagger starts.

**Stagger children**

## hello

``` jsx
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

const containerVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: { opacity: 1, transition: { staggerChildren: 0.1 } },
};
```

##### H5

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

Alt-H1
======

Alt-H2
------

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.

testing


[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
